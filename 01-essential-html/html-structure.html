            <h1>Chicken</h1>
            <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of
                domesticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl</a>. Chickens are one of the most common
                and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[1] up from more
                than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[2] Humans keep
                chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.
                Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
                Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BCE).</p>
            <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
                Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the
                Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
                Greece by the 5th century BCE.[6] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BCE, with the
                "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
                according to the annals of Thutmose III.</p>

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>Chicken once referred to young domestic fowl in general. The species as a whole was then called domestic
                fowl, or just fowl. This use of chicken survives in the phrase Hen and Chickens, sometimes used as a
                British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in
                the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands). The "hen and chickens" was also a name for the
                pentacycle, an early design of cargo cycle which had a large central driving wheel surrounded by four
                small stabiliser wheels.</p>

            <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
            <p>Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and
                shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter,
                bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright
                chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The
                identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the
                male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by
                colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging
                flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy
                protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles
                and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A muff or beard is a mutation found in
                several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of
                a beard. Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter chickens are
                generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would
                naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do
                so only to flee perceived danger.</p>
            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
            <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the
                incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others,
                establishing a "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting
                locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order
                until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock
                can lead to fighting and injury.[20] When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first.
                He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may
                also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.</p>
            <h4>Courtship</h4>
            <p>To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often
                lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[23] The dance triggers a response in the hen[23] and when
                she responds to his "call", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.</p>
